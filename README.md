# Landing Page (Scratch)
This is my first landing page project built from complete scratch using HTML/CSS. The purpose is to better my front-end development skills and put the things I've learned into practice. 

This is just a static webpage and has no functionality. My goal is to make it responsive and work well on both PC/Mobile devices.
